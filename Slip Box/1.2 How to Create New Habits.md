From [[Atomic Habits - James Clear]]

- A habit is a beahvior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic
- 
- Four Laws of habit change:
	1. How can I make it obvious?
	2. How can I make it simple?
	3. How can I make it easy?
	4. How can I make it satisfying?

-The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible

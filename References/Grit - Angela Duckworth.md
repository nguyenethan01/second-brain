### Summary

Grit has been probably the most impactful book that I have read thus far when it comes to self development. Writing this as of (10/25/20). It describes in detail how society puts too much of an emphasis on "natural born talent" when there is overwhelming evidence that hard work is much larger of a factor when it comes to success. It has completely changed my viewpoint on leaders, and has made me rethink the type of person I want to be and how to achieve that.

"We All Face Limits, But More Often Than Not Those Limits Are Self Imposed"

### Literature Notes

##### Part One: What Grit Is and Why It Matters
##### 1. Showing Up
- A West Point study showed that Grit (a combination of both determinance and passion) was the best determining factor as to who would graduate
- Grit is also the most determinant factor in high achievers across many fields 
- High acheiving people are very resilient and hardworking, and they know what they want.
- How talented someone is vs. how much grit they have are uncorrelated 
- Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another
- 
##### 2. Distracted By Talent
- **"The human individual lives usually far within his limits; he possesses powers of various sorts which h ehabitually fails to use. He energizes below his maximum, and he behaves below his optimum"**
- we tend to favor "naturals" which is bad
	- this leads to naturals not being able to handle failure, and leaves others to believe that grit doesn't matter as mcuh as it does
	- 
##### 3. Effort Counts Twice
- The most dazzling human achievements are, in fact, the aggretgate of countless individual elements, each of which is, in a sense, ordinary
- When we can't easily see how experience and training got someone to a level of excellence, we default to labeling person as a natural
- **"Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of teh genius, for if we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking" -Nietzche **
- Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort. Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them.
- Talent x Effort = Skill; Skill x Effort = Achievement
- "To do anything really well, you have to overextend yourself"
- 
##### 5. Grit Grows
- Interest, practice, purpose, hope are all things that you can develop and practice
#### Part Two: Growing Grit From the Inside Out

##### 6. Interest 
- Passion is a little bit of discovery, followed by a lot of development, and then a lifetime of deepening
- 
##### 7. Practice
- [[Deliberate Practice]]
- How to practice:
	- Set stretch goal
	- improve specific weaknesses
	- reach stretch goal
	- start with new stretch goal
	- 
##### 8. Purpose
- A lot of the most successful people believe what they do is for the benefit of other people

##### 9. Hope
- Change from I have a feeling tomorrow will be better to I resolve to make tomorrow better
- Believe that you can affect things and you will be able to 
- Train to be abn optimist
- Have a growth mindset, stuff like IQ can change

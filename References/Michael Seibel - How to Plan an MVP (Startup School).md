MVP : first thing you can give to potential users to check if you can provide any value at all to them

Goal of Pre-Launch Startup: 
- LAUNCH QUICKLY (rather get something bad out early)
- get initial customers
- talk to customers and get feedback 
- Iterate (improve your product)

Lean MVP - build it fast (weeks not months)
very limited functionality
Base to iterate from

Launch simply means to start getting any customers 

Hacks for building an MVP quickly
- time box your spec - your spec is a list of things that you need to build
- write your spec
- cut your spec
- don't fall in love with your MVP 


NEVER ASK USERS FOR FEATURES 
- ask them for problems rather than features

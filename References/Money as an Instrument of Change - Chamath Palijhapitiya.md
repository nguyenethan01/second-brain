Summary: [[Chamath Palihapitiya]] talks at the Stanford Graduate School of Business about money as an instrument of change, goals at [[Social Capital]]


Notes:

- Money as an instrument of change makes a lot of sense. This is why I want to make money. So that I can make as much of a positive contibution to the world as I can. 
- Capital markets are "out of their minds": delivery apps are getting billions in funding while there are no such comapanies for climate change : the buggest pressing issue of humanity.
- "Get the money" and then it will be a competition of views
	- Economic Incentives drive the world for better or for worse 
	- If you control the capital you can push your worldview
	- The more rational actors we have the better the system will be 
	- Don't sell out 
- 150 white men who rule the world
- VCs are well intentioned but here is what happens: 
	- They realize they have a gold star
	- Don't want to lose that gold star
	- They sell out and their motives change, become like veryone else
-Chamath is huge on not selling out

### Summary:

Atomic Habits was a book that really put some things that I already presumed were true into wording. The book is focused on tips about making habits stick, which usually start at a suprisingly minute level, hence the name Atomic Habits.  Emphasizes the power of "the aggregation of marginal gains". Some things that really stuck out to me about this book were changing your identity in order to make habits permanent, as well as habit stacking.

> “In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero.”

\- Charlie Munger

### Taking notes
- at end of each chapter write few bullet points that summarize. Connect to your own life. Write any unanswered questions 
- A week after finishing the book, go through notes, write down all the good notes.

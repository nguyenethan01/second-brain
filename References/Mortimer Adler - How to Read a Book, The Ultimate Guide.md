Reading for understanding vs reading for information

Something to keep in mind: Anything easily digested is reading for information (newspapers)

> “Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him.”

\-   Edgar Allen Poe

Mortimer Adler's four levels of reading
1. Elementary 
2. Inspectional 
	- Basically a skim read, can be really useful to determine if a book is worth reading
	- two types
		1.  Systematic Skimming - quick check of book by reading preface, studying table of contents, checking index, reading inside jacket
			- answers the question: Does this book deserve more of my time?
		2.  Superficial Reading - when you only read, nothing else 
3. Analytical 
	- through reading, take notes in margins
	- four steps
		1. classify book according to kind and subject matter
		2. state what whole book is about concisely 
		3. enumerate major parts in order and relation, outline each part
		4. define problems author is trying to solve
4. Syntopical
	- reading many books on same subject and comparing ideas 
	- five steps
		1. finding relevant passages
		2. bringing author to terms
		3. getting the questions clear
		4. defining issues
		5. analyzing discussion 

### Four questions to ask about every book
- what is this book about 
- what is being said in detail and how 
- is the book true in whole or in part
- what of it?

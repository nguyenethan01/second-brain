From [[Atomic Habits - James Clear]]:

- Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are
- Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity
- Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity
- Contemplation of the Sage (aspire to become the best version of yourself. Ask what would _____ do?)
- feedback loops

Best founders maintain direct connection to users throughout lifespan of company

Cannot outsource to sales, heads of product

YC: In order to start a company, you need to be able to code, and you need to be able to talk to users

### 3 common errors people make when conducting user interviews:
- talk about their life, not your idea 
- talk specifics, not hypotheticals 
	- questions like: if we built this..... would you be interested
	- talk about specifics that have already occured in the user's life
	- talk in general about user's life, not just about the solution you are pitching
	- learn about motivations, what path they took to reach the problem
- Listen, don't talk

### 5 great questions you can ask in every interview
1. What is the hardest part about doing the thing you are trying to solve
	- Best startups solve problems that occur regularly enough to be a painpoint that people would want to solve
2. "Tell me about the last time that you encountered this problem"
	- extract context about the time in which users encountered a problem
3. Why was that hard?
	- understand how to market, expain value of your product
	- "customers don't buy the what, they buy the why"
4. What, if anything, have you done to try to solve this problem?
	- If customers are not already exploring potential solutions, it is possible problem you are trying to solve may not be big enough of a problem
5. What don't you love about the solutions that you have already tried?
	- understand your feature set 

Talking to users useful at all stages:
- Idea -> find users with problem
	- talk to friends
	- just show up
	- industry events
	- tips:
		- take notes
		- keep it casual
		- be cognizant of other person's time
- Prototype -> best first customer
	- Identify who is your first best customer
		- if you pick one incorrectly, you may be led down an incorrect path
	- Find numerical answers to:
		- how much does this problem costs them today?
		- how frequently do they encoumter this problem?
		- how large is their budget for solving this problem?
		- imagine these three categories as a venn diagram, best ideas fall in the middle, or the union of all 3 categories
- Launched -> find product market fit
	- iterate towards Product Market Fit
	- Paul Graham's definition of PMF: when you've made something that people want 
	- ask for phone number during sign up
 


Big takeaways:
- "customers don't buy the what, they buy the why"
